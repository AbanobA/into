Serialization library
=====================

The task of the serialization library is to marshal and demarshal data
structures. It uses a rather complex template mechanism to generate
(de)serialization code at compile time. The result is efficient,
compact and almost unreadable code. The following documentation pages
will wall you through the concepts, philosophy and use of the library.
