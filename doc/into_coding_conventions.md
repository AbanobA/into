Coding Conventions
==================

The purpose of this document is to achieve the impossible: make the
work of a team of programmers look uniform. We are not going into
details on why standardization is important or why we selected this
stupid convention over the one you like. The discussion would be
endless. All code in Into must adhere to the guidelines given here.
No excuses will be accepted.

This document is divided into the following subsections:

- [Indentation](into_conventions_indentation)
- [Naming](into_conventions_naming defines)
- [Binary compatibility](into_conventions_binary_compatibility)
- [Documentation](into_conventions_documentation)
- [Miscellaneous](into_conventions_misc)
